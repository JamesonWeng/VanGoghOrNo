todo list / ideas to try:

- implement precision/recall/f1_score for metric
- experiment with architecture, batch size
- oversample the positive examples to balance the datasets
- generate data, e.g. with rotations, reflections
- different optimizers; sgd, adam, rmsprop
- featurewise normalization?
- investigate gpu for speed

- check that ImageDataGenerator is shuffling between classes - done
